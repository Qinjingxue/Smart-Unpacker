# Performance benchmarks

Performance measurements and diagnostic profiles live here; behavioural assertions live under `tests/`.

List the supported scenarios:

```powershell
python -m benchmarks --list

## Run timeout

Every scenario runs in a child process under a hard wall-clock deadline, so a
stale scenario that calls a removed API and blocks forever is killed instead
of hanging the whole benchmark run.  The global limit defaults to 3600 seconds
and can be overridden before the scenario name, or via
`SUNPACK_BENCH_TIMEOUT`:

```powershell
python -m benchmarks --timeout 600 extraction format-matrix --runs 3
```

A killed scenario exits with code 124.  Scenario-internal subprocesses (7-Zip,
the CLI client, native workers, worker children) all carry their own timeouts
too; they honour `SUNPACK_BENCH_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT` (default 600s) where
applicable.

## Real archive workspace lifecycle

Scenarios that generate real archives use `BenchmarkWorkspace` and share this lifecycle:

1. Create corpus, work, and extraction-output directories under `benchmarks/.work/`.
2. Generate archives through the existing `ArchiveFixtureFactory` or scenario corpus builder.
3. Always write `report.json` and `manifest.json` under
   `benchmarks/results/<scenario>/<UTC timestamp>-<run id>/`.
4. Remove the complete temporary work directory when the scenario exits, including on failure.

Use `--results-root PATH` to put durable results elsewhere. By default, durable benchmark
results are stored under `benchmarks/results/`. Use `--keep-workdir` only when
debugging a generated archive; the retained path is recorded in `manifest.json`. Temporary
archives are never copied to the durable result directory implicitly, so large corpora do not
accumulate. A scenario may explicitly preserve a small diagnostic artifact with the workspace API.

Remove regenerable benchmark data without touching versioned reports:

```powershell
python -m benchmarks clean --cache --work
```

`extraction format-matrix` builds ZIP, 7z, split 7z, RAR, split RAR, TAR, gzip,
bzip2, xz, zstd and the conventional compressed-TAR aliases. It uses the bundled
binaries under `tools/`. Each archive is placed in an isolated scanner input directory,
then both SunPack's complete detection/extraction flow and raw 7-Zip are timed. Only
cases where both extractors exit successfully contribute to the comparison ratio;
payload-content correctness is covered by dedicated correctness tests, so the matrix
does not re-hash extracted files.
The matrix starts extractor commands strictly one at a time, while leaving SunPack's internal scheduler at its program-controlled
default and using unlimited recursive extraction. Generated scanner entry files are
rejected when they fall below the project's 1 MiB recognition floor.

The format matrix now uses an adaptive host-pressure gate before every extractor launch.
Tune it with `--max-cpu-percent`, `--min-available-memory-percent`, and
`--pressure-max-wait-seconds`; `--case-cooldown-seconds` is an optional extra fixed delay.
Generated corpora are content-addressed under `benchmarks/.cache/` and can be refreshed
with `--rebuild-corpus-cache` or disabled with `--no-corpus-cache`. Use repeated `--format`
options for a focused run. One diagnostic extraction per case reuses the large-archive
runtime profiler and writes phase medians and per-format aggregates into the report; use
`--no-phase-profile` when only end-to-end timing is needed. For stable internal medians,
set `--phase-profile-warmups 1 --phase-profile-runs 3`.

The format matrix reports live progress by default: timestamped lines on stderr show the
current phase (`corpus`, `detection`, `extraction_matrix`, `phase_profiles`, `report`),
the case/run/label being executed, and each operation's wall time. The cumulative phase
breakdown is recorded in the report's `phase_timing_seconds` and printed to stderr at the
end. Disable this with `--no-progress`. Progress always goes to stderr, so the
detection-worker subprocess keeps its stdout JSON contract intact; the parent forwards the
worker's stderr so per-archive scan progress is visible live.

The reusable harness in `benchmarks/harness` defines the common wall/CPU clocks,
RSS/Private Bytes process-tree memory sampling, real-archive workspace lifecycle, and
versioned JSON report envelope. New scenarios must use those components instead of
adding another local timer, memory sampler, or temporary-directory policy.

`extraction sevenzip-worker-matrix` measures the native persistent
`sunpack_sevenzip_worker.exe` directly. It reuses the format-matrix corpus builder,
generates tiny/small/medium/large profiles by default, and records per-run worker wall time,
worker CPU time, child-process RSS peak, output statistics, native status, and failures.
Use repeated or comma-separated `--profile` values and repeated `--format` values to
focus the matrix. Durable results contain both `report.json` and `results.csv`.

`extraction worker-small-file-scheduling` measures the worker-internal thread
scheduler under a deliberately adversarial many-small-file workload. It creates
one small ZIP per job and submits each request's full burst before the next
request, then sweeps `--capacities` (native thread counts). Per run it records
throughput, observed active-job peak, time-weighted thread-capacity utilization,
queue/service latency percentiles, queued-but-underutilized thread time,
worker CPU/RSS/read/write utilization, early- and overall-admission Jain fairness,
the spread to each request's first admission, and the longest same-request admission
run. The early index detects short-term monopolization; the overall index detects
whether requests receive equal admission counts by the end of the batch.

`extraction worker-resource-pressure` uses real 7z archives and the native worker
to measure resource contention rather than synthetic weights. `cpu` uses highly
compressible LZMA2 data with a large dictionary to stress decoding; `io` uses
random data with `-mx=0` to stress archive reads and output writes; `memory` uses
LZMA2 decoder dictionaries with a deliberately small worker memory budget. It
compares the adaptive controller with a fixed active-job limit and records worker
CPU, host CPU, read throughput, worker RSS, admitted jobs, reservation totals,
timeouts, and result failures. Repeat the memory case with `--dictionary-hint` and
`--no-dictionary-hint` to distinguish accurate decoder reservations from
underestimated reservations. These are pressure probes, not a hard RSS limit or a
proof that arbitrary archives cannot exhaust system memory.

`memory many-tasks` measures memory *growth* (not peak) of the two long-lived
components under a large task count across every format: the Python pipeline and
the native 7z worker. One mixed-format corpus is built with the format-matrix
builder (archives kept above the 1 MiB scanner floor, e.g.
`--small-files 1100 --large-files 2 --large-file-mib 1`), then:

- phase `python` re-runs the whole corpus through the persistent-runtime
  `extract` pipeline once per round (`--python-rounds`, default 5) and samples
  the Python process RSS/private/tracemalloc/native reader cache after every
  round, plus the residual after the engine closes;
- phase `worker` feeds every archive through one persistent
  `sunpack_sevenzip_worker.exe` (`--worker-rounds`, default 3) and samples the
  worker process RSS after every job, so per-format and cumulative growth come
  straight out of the trajectory.

Use `--format` to restrict formats, `--skip-python` / `--skip-worker` to run a
single phase, and `--json-out` for a durable copy.

`reader embedded-scan --generate-gib 10 --rounds 1 --skip-cli` creates a streamed
ZIP64 fixture under the benchmark workspace, measures native embedded-scan wall/CPU
time and process memory peaks, and writes the report to the durable `benchmarks/results`
directory. The generated archive is removed automatically unless `--keep-workdir` is
supplied. The 10 GiB member is stored (not highly compressed), so generation is not
part of the measured scan operation and the run exercises a large-file scan directly.
The embedded scanner uses the bounded `ReadFile(OVERLAPPED)`/IOCP pipeline by
default. IOCP uses a separate scan-local handle and reports `scan_read_bytes` and
`scan_read_operations`; tune it
with `--iocp-chunk-mib`, `--iocp-buffers`, and `--iocp-workers` without changing
the normal reader cache or `read_at()` behavior. `iocp-buffers` controls the
bounded in-flight read depth; `iocp-workers` controls parallel signature
scanning independently.

`reader embedded-scan --generate-plan5-mib 500 --rounds 3 --skip-cli` creates a
500 MiB carrier around the real Plan 5 embedded-archive matrix. The matrix has
128 independently generated archives and covers ZIP, 7z, RAR4/5, TAR, gzip,
bzip2, xz, and zstd plus their container/codec variants. The scenario verifies
every expected format/offset on every measured run, so throughput results cannot
hide candidate-validation regressions or missed archives.

`extraction real-archive` measures the current architecture: `sunpack extract`
delegates to the long-lived persistent server process, so RSS accounting
includes the CLI client's process tree plus the persistent server and its
native 7-Zip worker (baseline service RSS is subtracted as idle overhead).
Each run has a per-run timeout (`--timeout`, default 600s); a timed-out run is
reported with exit code -124 and the server is shut down so the next run
starts from a clean baseline.

`extraction split-pressure` and `extraction large-archive-profile` drive the
async `PipelineEngine` (one event loop per submission) and instrument the
per-request runtime through the private runtime-factory seam. Timing columns
reflect the current pipeline stages: `pipeline_scan`, `input_planning`,
`batch_prepare`/`batch_execute`/`batch_collect_result`, `output_scan`,
`password_resolve`, `verify`, `resource`, and `extract_ms` (the pipeline wall
minus every measured stage, since native extraction runs asynchronously
through the worker). Stages removed by the refactor report 0.0.

The following obsolete probes were intentionally removed during consolidation:

- cache saturation and idle-thread scripts that inspected `_ENGINE`, `_runtime`, and `_SESSIONS`;
- the standalone scan-layer probe, subsumed by `scan hotspots --mode ...`;
- the hard-coded nested-authorization microbenchmark;
- the PowerShell memory stress script;
- the separate SunPack-versus-7-Zip runner, subsumed by the format matrix baseline.

Use pytest only for stable product contracts. Opt-in timing/resource assertions are
marked `performance` and run with `pytest --run-performance`; multi-GB resource-guard
tests additionally require `--run-large-archive-performance`.
